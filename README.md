# Glume Healthcare Dashboard in Flutter

A Flutter implementation of the **[Glume Healthcare Mobile App UI for Diabetics](https://dribbble.com/shots/19039354-Glume-Healthcare-Mobile-App-UI-Design-for-Diabetics)** seen on Dribbble.  
This project recreates the dark-themed diabetes dashboard with smooth charts, pill navigation, and profile screens — staying as faithful to the original design as possible.
